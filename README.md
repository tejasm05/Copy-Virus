# Copy-Virus
In development, has problems but doesn't give errors since it's made with try , except blocks. Basically duplicates the files and eats your hard drive up. Caution, it's malware

 the code does the following things:
  Copies itself to three different locations, the paths are constructed automatically. # but this doesnt work mainly because shutil module in python sucks.
  Then it regedits the three different files # which is also not working because the files aren't getting copied in the first place
  Locates the videos folder in your computer and starts copying content over and over again in folder in a while loop.
  This results to nearly no space remaining in your videos folder in C drive.
